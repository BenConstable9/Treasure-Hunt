This is the final screenshots for our project.

As seen at the top part of Validation(Done), there are a number of bug cards.

Yesterday (10th March 2020), we finished all functionality cards and then deployed our project and tested the game as if it was live.
Upon testing, there was a number of bugs that arose - some related to mobile design and others for functionality.

As a result, we all quickly fixed the bug as we had stated we would have a working program on 10th March 2020 and wanted to stick to
this deadline.
