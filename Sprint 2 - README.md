This is a submission for Sprint 2. There are three types of documents that you will find the following places.

## PROCESS DOCUMENTS
Our process documents are managed in the GitHub Projects platform. The link to our project page is below. We (BenConstable9) have added mattcollison to the board so it is visible.

GitHub Project Kanban Board link: [https://github.com/BenConstable9/Treasure-Hunt/projects/1] (User must be logged in and added to the Project)

We have also taken regular snapshots of the Kanban Board to archive our progress. These are held in the repository below.

[./Process-Documents/Kanban-Board-Screenshots/](./Process-Documents/Kanban-Board-Screenshots/)

Within process documents we have also included the meeting notes, agenda and minutes. These will be found in the repository below.

[./Process-Documents/Meeting-Documents/](./Process-Documents/Meeting-Documents/)

Other process documents can be found within the Process-Documents directory, such as Kanban Board Card Policy.


## TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS
Our technical documents are primarily managed on the GitHub system. The link to the project is below:

GitHub link: [https://github.com/BenConstable9/Treasure-Hunt/tree/Deployment/Technical-Documents]

We have also include the versioned source code for archiving.

[./Technical-Documents/](./Technical-Documents/)

Technical documents are broken down into Model-View-Controller, Routes, Configs and Static files.  

In this sprint, we have created a new branch called Deployment that only contains the most recent version release code. Incremental changes will occur in the master and other branches. The viewable hosted product is a copy of the Deployment branch (see Product Documents section).

## PRODUCT DOCUMENTS
Our product documents are primarily in the form of a product UI. Below is a link to our latest version.
